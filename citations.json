    "abstract": "We analyze empirical data from the Erdős Problems AI Contributions Wiki, a dataset maintained by Terence Tao and collaborators documenting AI contributions to over 1,000 open mathematical problems. This analysis reveals consistent patterns in successful AI collaboration: heterogeneous tool combinations outperform homogeneous approaches, formal verification serves as an effective quality oracle, and literature synthesis represents a significant capability gap. Subsequent validation from Sakana AI's AB-MCTS (Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search) confirms that heterogeneous multi-LLM ensembles significantly outperform individual models on reasoning benchmarks. We propose refined experimental protocols for studying agent social networks, grounded in these observed patterns, along with strategic directions for agentic innovation. Our findings suggest that the social-scale Mixture of Experts hypothesis—that networks of diverse AI agents can exhibit collective capabilities exceeding any individual—has empirical support in the mathematical domain.",

    "abstract": "Hallucination has been widely recognized to be a significant drawback for large language models (LLMs). There have been many works that attempt to reduce the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far, which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all the computable functions and will therefore inevitably hallucinate if used as general problem solvers. Since the formal world is a part of the real world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs.",
